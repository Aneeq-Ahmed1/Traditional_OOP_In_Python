# üêç Python OOP Assignment

## üìö Objective
This assignment covers **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using Python.  
Each task focuses on a specific concept like **self, class methods, inheritance, abstraction, decorators, exceptions**, and more.

The goal is to **understand, implement, and practice** OOP in Python with simple examples.

---

## üìã Tasks Overview

### 1. Using `self`
- Create a `Student` class with `name` and `marks`.
- Initialize using `self` in the constructor.
- Add `display()` method to show details.

---

### 2. Using `cls`
- Create a `Counter` class.
- Use class variable + `cls` method to track object count.

---

### 3. Public Variables and Methods
- Create a `Car` class.
- Use a public variable `brand` and a method `start()` accessible outside the class.

---

### 4. Class Variables and Class Methods
- Create a `Bank` class with a class variable `bank_name`.
- Add a method to change bank name affecting all instances.

---

### 5. Static Variables and Static Methods
- Create a `MathUtils` class.
- Use a static method `add(a, b)` without using class/instance variables.

---

### 6. Constructors and Destructors
- Create a `Logger` class.
- Print a message when object is created and another when destroyed.

---

### 7. Access Modifiers (Public, Protected, Private)
- Create an `Employee` class with:
  - Public: `name`
  - Protected: `_salary`
  - Private: `__ssn`
- Try accessing all three variables.

---

### 8. The `super()` Function
- Create a `Person` class.
- Inherit `Teacher` class, call base class constructor using `super()`.

---

### 9. Abstract Classes and Methods
- Create an abstract class `Shape` using `abc` module.
- Implement `area()` method in `Rectangle` class.

---

### 10. Instance Methods
- Create a `Dog` class with attributes `name` and `breed`.
- Add an instance method `bark()` that prints the dog's name.

---

### 11. Class Methods
- Create a `Book` class with class variable `total_books`.
- Use class method to increment book count.

---

### 12. Static Methods
- Create a `TemperatureConverter` class.
- Add a static method `celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)`.

---

### 13. Composition
- Create an `Engine` and a `Car` class.
- Pass an `Engine` object into `Car` (composition).

---

### 14. Aggregation
- Create a `Department` and an `Employee` class.
- Department stores a reference to Employee object independently.

---

### 15. MRO and Diamond Inheritance
- Create 4 classes: `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`.
- `D` inherits from `B` and `C`.
- Check Method Resolution Order (MRO) by calling `show()`.

---

### 16. Function Decorators
- Create a decorator `log_function_call`.
- Decorate a function `say_hello()` to print a message before execution.

---

### 17. Class Decorators
- Create a class decorator `add_greeting`.
- Modify a class `Person` to add a `greet()` method dynamically.

---

### 18. Property Decorators (`@property`, `@setter`, `@deleter`)
- Create a `Product` class.
- Use property decorators to get, set, and delete `_price`.

---

### 19. `callable()` and `__call__()`
- Create a `Multiplier` class.
- Implement `__call__()` to multiply input by a factor.

---

### 20. Creating a Custom Exception
- Create an exception `InvalidAgeError`.
- Use it in `check_age(age)` function if age < 18.

---

### 21. Make a Custom Class Iterable
- Create a `Countdown` class.
- Implement `__iter__()` and `__next__()` to countdown from start number to 0.

---

## üöÄ Submission
Once you complete all tasks, submit your assignment using the provided form.

---

## üåü Notes
- Focus on clean code.
- Use meaningful class, variable, and method names.
- Add comments if needed for clarity.
- Enjoy coding and learning OOP!
